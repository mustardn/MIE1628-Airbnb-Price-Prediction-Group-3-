If a mattress is stained, the warranty is void so it will be guests responsibility if they are stained. 2- The kitchen has granite sink and it can be only cleaned with mild soft cleaners.  Do not use detergents, abrasive substances or metal cleaning pods to clean the sink because they scratch the surface, making it susceptible to stains. CAUTION! Do not pour alcohol, gasoline, acid or any solvents in general into or onto the sink because they could interact with the chemical structure of the sink and damage it beyond repair.

Guests under the age of 25  are still entirely welcome – they will just need to be accompanied by parents or guardians. - 2) The easiest way to disrupt an enjoyable stay is a plumbing problem. To prevent this, we kindly ask you to please place things like sanity napkins in the sanitary bin we’ve provided in the bathroom. We simply want to ensure you have a royal flush kind of holiday  - 3) If you’re coming to the city to party you’ve picked a great city to do so. Unfortunately, just not at our place. Though we’re sure it won’t come to it, serious complaints of unruly behavior will unfortunately result in you being asked to leave. Not good for you. Not good for us. - 4) Check-in is at 3pm, and check-out is by 11am. Arriving slightly earlier, or want that extra hour to sleep?
